   "Storyline": "One of the greatest epics, Ramayan, written by Valmiki, unravels the journey of Lord Rama, right from his marriage to Sita to the slaying of Ravana. Rama, the eldest son of King Dashratha, is the heir apparent to the throne of Ayodhya, but Dashratha is compelled by Kaikeyi to make her son Bharat the king. Kaikeyi further asks Dashratha to send Rama on exile for 14 years, so Rama willingly agrees. He leaves, accompanied by Sita and his younger brother Laxmana. However, when Bharat learns of his mother's viciousness, he goes to the jungle to persuade Rama to return to Ayodhya. But he comes back only with Rama's sandals that he places on the throne. Years later, Sita is abducted by Ravana, the King of Lanka. Rama, with the help of the Monkey God Hanuman and Laxmana, goes to Lanka to slay Ravana and bring back Sita.",

In 1947, the sub continent became India, East (now Bangladesh) and West Pakistan (today's Pakistan). The series pretended to keep memories and truths about the partition alive, at a time when many Indians and Pakistanis seemed to be forgetting this historical tragedy. The miniseries became a landmark 297 minute, 35mm film, now shown mostly at Indian Film Festivals. The film is based on the book by Brisham Sahni, himself a refugee to India from West Punjab, now in Pakistan. Thus fittingly, this epic looks at Partition from an Indian Punjabi perspective, as the fate of Sikh and Hindu families in West Punjab is emphasized.

In fact, not even the police have the will to deal with them, courtesy Tulsidas' exceptionally stupid elder son Praful and his equivalently stupid wife Hansa, gossip obsessed widowed daughter-in-law Jayshree and Hansa's similarly foolish caterer brother Himanshu. Tulsidas' only respite are his intelligent grandchildren, Jayshree's son Jackie and Praful's and Hansa's daughter Chakki. The madcap family sets out on bizarre adventures in each episode, everytime resulting in hilarious chaos.\nWritten by\nankit-singh92",
